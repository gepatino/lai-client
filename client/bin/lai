# How to use lai from anywhere:
# =============================
# If you have ~/bin in your $PATH,
# make a symbolic link to this file:
# ln -s /home/xleo/src/lvidarte/lai/client/bin/lai ~/bin


# Put here the absolute path to lai module
#LAIPATH=/home/xleo/src/lvidarte/lai/client
LAIPATH=


if [ -z "$LAIPATH" ]
then
    echo "You need to set up the LAIPATH variable with the absolute path to lai module."
else
    # Export path for virtualenv
    export PYTHONPATH=$LAIPATH

    # Activate virtualenv
    source $LAIPATH/env/bin/activate

    # Run the app
    python $LAIPATH/lai/app.py "$@"

    # Finally..
    deactivate
